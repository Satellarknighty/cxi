Welcome to my personal repo. Here I showcase the projects I have done at my university, as well as some of my hobby projects.

1. swp_gruppe_17\
   This is my first attempt to pass the module Software Project at my uni, where we work as a team to make a piece of software. The task was to implement a flashcard software that helps user learn things and memorize. Here I have learnt the MVC pattern, core Java, and Java Swing to design UI.

2. Even Geiler Than Geiler Than Faster Than Light\
   This is my second attempt for Software Project which fortunately succeeded. The task this time is to create a game, or rather our own version of the game "Faster than light". Here I used JMonkeyEngine as framework, and also made use of JPA/Hibernate as embedded database to save game files.

3. uni-notes\
   This is my personal learning project to learn Spring and Spring Boot. The product of this project should help me store and keep track of my notes/scores from the uni. I wanted to make a simple Backend where it would take handmade requests from Postman and process them into information so I can store them in my database.

The rest are just hobby projects that aren't too interesting.
